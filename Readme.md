## Introduction

This project, which is actually 100 small projects - is to build my skills as a python developer to a professional level. Within this repository by the end of the challenge there will be 100 separate projects ranging from beginner to advanced levels of programming knowledge that will demonstrate my ability as a python developer.

Project Objectives:

* Build 100 unique projects in python ranging from beginner to advanced levels
* Improve my python skills and get a professional level of experience in python
* Build projects that help enrich my life and that are relevant to me as an individual
* Demonstrate my coding ability in a portfolio

Each project will have it's own comment at the top of the document which explains the nature and scope of that specific project however there will be a brief description of each project in this main readme file below. The technologies section of this readme will be updated as new projects are built.

## Project List

* Day 1 - Band Name Generator (Demonstrates use of string input and concatenation, as well as f strings)
* Day 2 - Tip Calculator (Demonstrates use of math operations, as well as while and try blocks)
* Day 3 - Text Adventure game (Demonstrates use of Regex and control flow - also made a story board for game, and used pyinstaller to export it as an executable - pretty proud of this one)
* Day 4 - Rock, Paper, Scissors game (Demonstrates use of the Random module, as well as knowledge of lists)
* Day 5 - Strong Password Generator (Demonstrates use of loops, particularly for loops)
* Day 6 - Turtle Game (This project was completed on a special website where you control a turtle with functions in order to get him through an obstacle course, this was to develop understanding of functions but since it was on a platform there is no Day 6 folder)
* Day 7 - Hangman (Demonstrates understanding of breaking down more complex tasks and control flow, I also wrote
a little web scraper to pull down a most frequent nouns list because I'm a show off...)
* Day 8 - Caeser Cipher Encoder/Decoder (Demonstrates understanding of functions which take arguments, I also
added in a little extra by making a decoder that can decode the message even without a shift)

## Technologies

* Python 3.9
* BeautifulSoup (install where necessary)
* pyinstaller (install where necessary)

## Setup

* You should have python 3.9 installed on your machine
